This repository contains a simple Rust program that illustrates a common confusion for newcomers: mutable references.  The `bug.rs` file shows how multiple mutable references to the same variable can exist concurrently provided they don't overlap in their lifetime.  Attempts to mix mutable and immutable references in an unsafe way result in compile-time errors which is a core feature preventing data races. The solution demonstrates the proper use of mutable references, highlighting best practices and error prevention strategies in Rust.
